This capstone project was created by Jesus Gonzalez, Marco Pigna, Mike Drake, and RC Wright III for Fullstack University's cybersecurity boot camp, which ran from November  13th, 2023, to February 16th, 2024. This project aims to highlight how legacy RATs (Remote Access Trojans) are still a threat to devices running modern versions of Android, the danger they pose to individuals and businesses, and what security measures effectively block these legacy RATs.
